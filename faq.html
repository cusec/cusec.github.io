    <h5>What is CUSEC?</h5>
    <p>
    CUSEC is the Canadian University Software Engineering Conference, an annual conference about the most interesting topics in software engineering organized for and by students from universities across Canada. What makes CUSEC unique is that it is the only software specific conference that targets students. This means that the presentations you’ll see at CUSEC will be about things that matter to you, not just things that matter to professional developers.
    </p>

    <h5>Who should attend CUSEC?</h5>
    <p>
    CUSEC attendees are made up largely of students in Software Engineering and Computer Science programs in Canadian universities. But we also welcome professional developers and academic researchers alike. If you have a passion for software design, learning the state-of-the-art in communication and processes, and want to meet and socialize with like-minded students from across North America, then you belong at CUSEC.
    </p>

    <h5>What do I get from going to CUSEC?</h5>
    <p>
    At CUSEC you will learn from the most influential leaders of software engineering. You will likely learn more at 3 days of CUSEC than you’ll have learned in your entire first year of university.
    </p>    
    <p>
    And that’s not even the best part. At CUSEC, you will get the chance to meet and interact with other students from all over Canada. You’ll be able to talk together, learn together and from each other, and party together. You’ll make friends that like the same things you do.
    </p>
    <p>
    There is also the annual career fair where sponsors interview and seek out students for co-op, internship or full time opportunities. CUSEC is a great place to further or start your professional career, so bring your resumes.

Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-­harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.

<p>
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.
